    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      I am Garrett Udstrand (<a href="mailto:udstr013@umn.edu"
        >udstr013@umn.edu</a
      >). This is my website submission for Project 2 in CSCI 5611. The example
      video of the project can be viewed below.
    </p>

    <h1>Features</h1>
    <p>
      My submission, this time around, is pretty bare bones. I simply simulate a
      cloth in a 3D environment and give the user a camera to navigate the
      environment. It runs pretty fast, only dipping to 45 fps at lowest on my
      laptop, which doesn't have the greatest of GPUs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Running the project will start you off with a cloth in front of you and an
      obstacle underneath it. Hitting the spacebar allows updates to happen and
      makes the cloth fall. Hitting 'r' resets the simulation. The WASD keys are
      used to move the camera around, and you can rotate the camera by using the
      arrow keys. Dragging the mouse around while paused allows you to move the
      obstacle, so you can try out the simulation against many different
      obstacle positions.
    </p>

    <h1>Project Features I Attempted</h1>
    <h2>Multiple Ropes</h2>
    <p>
      This one was required, so, of course, I implemented it. As you will see in
      the next section, I extended this multiple rope simulation to be a
      full-fledged cloth simulation, so there are no literal ropes being
      displayed in the simulation, just rope calculations being used implicitly
      in the cloth simulation.
    </p>
    <h2>Cloth Simulation</h2>
    <p>
      I added horizontal ropes as the instructions directed and was able to
      create a simulated version of a cloth. I use a fairly standard example,
      with the cloth falling onto a ball and making satisfying cloth-like
      motions due to hitting the ball. I placed the ball slightly off center, so
      you get this really interesting side-to-side movement in the cloth that
      reminds me of clothes flowing in the breeze. This cloth simulation is seen
      throughout the video.
    </p>
    <h2>3D Simulation</h2>
    <p>
      The simulation is done in 3D and a user can use the camera to move around
      it. You simply hit the WASD keys to move, and the arrow keys to change the
      camera's rotation. It's almost like a video game, but using arrow keys
      rather than the mouse. You can see the camera being used to get different
      angles of the 3D environment at approximately 10 seconds in and 25 seconds
      in. You can see the camera being used more dynamically below, with it
      being moved around while the simulation is going, just to see what the
      cloth looks like from different angles.

      </video>
    </p>
    <h2>User Interaction</h2>
    <p>
      By dragging the mouse around, you can move the obstacle to see the cloth
      interact with it in different ways. I only allow you to move it when the
      simulation is paused, however, as moving the ball while the cloth is
      moving can lead to glitchy behavior. I should also note that if you move
      the ball so that the cloth and the ball are inside one another, the
      simulation will also glitch out and break. You can see the ball moved at
      approximately 19 seconds into the video and 36 seconds into the video. You
      can see an example of me breaking the simulation below.

      </video>
    </p>
    <h2>Realistic Speed</h2>
    <p>
      I tried to match up my cloth's speed to something like a big, billowy
      blanket. I wanted the cloth to feel weighty and comfy when seen in
      movement, which I think I certainly achieved, but that's subjective, I
      guess.
    </p>

    <h1>Code</h1>
    <p>
      The simulation was written using
      <a href="https://processing.org/">processing</a>, and the camera is mostly
      copied from the
      <a
        href="https://canvas.umn.edu/courses/333142/files/30097263?module_item_id=8786154"
      >
        camera.pde example provided on Canvas</a
      >. The in-class rope activity was used as a base for creating the
      simulation, but it has been significantly modified. Almost none of the
      original code remains.

    <h1>Difficulties</h1>
    <h2>Collision with the Sphere</h2>
    <p>
      While we have discussed collisions quite a bit in class, it's a bit more
      difficult to get good looking collisions with the cloth. It deforms and
      kind of stretches and this can be difficult to work with. If the cloth
      deforms too much on the sphere, and the push is not strong enough, the
      sphere will show through the cloth and it will look bad. However, setting
      too strong of forces can make the cloth float. It can also make it jitter,
      which is a problem still kind of present in my final submission.
    </p>
    <p>
      A solution I was interested in pursuing was testing the intersection
      between triangles and the sphere rather than between individual points.
      Because there are configurations where the individual points of a triangle
      will be outside the sphere, but the actual rendered triangle is still
      clipping it. To test this intersection, you'd simply treat the triangle as
      a plane and use the
      <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(geometry)#Distance_from_a_point_to_a_plane"
      >
        distance from a point to a plane
      </a>
      equation. If the distance calculated is less than the radius of the sphere
      plus some tuning value, you push the plane outwards until that distance is
      greater than those two values. The problem with that solution, though, is
      it's really hard to implement pushing the plane outwards. How exactly you
      change the points, so that they remain relationally the same, but still
      move the distance of the plane from the center of the obstacle out, is not
      exactly clear, and my linear algebra knowledge was not good enough to make
      it happen in time.
    </p>
    <p>
      As you probably saw in the features section, the collision system sort of
      breaks if the obstacle being collided does not start on the outside of the
      sphere. I spent forever debugging this, and I couldn't come to a
      particularly satisfying conclusion on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall, it mainly came down to using the same basic logic, but tinkering
      quite a bit with the parameters until the collision looked good and
      produced a good looking cloth movement.
    </p>
    <h2>Non-Angular Cloth</h2>
    <p>
      If you don't have enough polygons to render the cloth, it can look very
      angular and it breaks the immersion quite a bit. The problem is that
      adding too many polygons can give your computer quite the hit, and will
      reduce how smooth you can make the overall motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just like before, there was no supremely elegant solution to this problem,
      and, if there is one, I simply didn't have the time to work it out.
      Instead, I just adjusted the parameters until I had a good balance between
      the amount of polygons and the smoothness of motion.
    </p>
    <h2>Computing Proper Normal Vectors</h2>
    <p>
      I made attempts to include both drag and more proper lighting in this
      simulation, but I had to scrap both because they were glitching out on me,
      which I believe was due to the cross product. For the drag and for the
      lighting, we want our normal in a particular direction, so that the
      calculations work properly. However, the cross product only chooses its
      direction via the right-hand rule, and I had situations where the cross
      product would suddenly flip, and cause either the lighting or the drag to
      wig out and look bad. Perhaps, with more debugging, I could've fixed it,
      but I decided to pursue other avenues to get a nice simulation.
