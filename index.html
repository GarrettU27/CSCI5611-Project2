    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      I am Garrett Udstrand (<a href="mailto:udstr013@umn.edu">udstr013@umn.edu</a>).
      This is my website submission for Project 2 in CSCI 5611. The
      example video of the project can be viewed below.
    </p>

    <h1>Features</h1>
    <p>
        My submission, this time around, is pretty bare bones. I simply simulate a cloth
        in a 3D environment and give the user a camera to navigate the environment. It runs pretty
        fast, only dipping to 45 fps at lowest  on my laptop, which doesn't have the
        greatest of GPUs.
    </p>
    <p>
        Running the project will start you off with a cloth in front of you and an obstacle underneath
        it. Hitting the spacebar allows updates to happen and makes the cloth fall. Hitting 'r' resets
        the simulation. The WASD keys are used to move the camera around, and you can rotate the camera
        by using the arrow keys.
    </p>

    <h1>Project Features I Attempted</h1>
    <h2>Multiple Ropes</h2>
    <p>
      This one was required, so, of course, I implemented it. As you will see in
      the next section, I extended this multiple rope simulation to be a full-fledged
      cloth simulation, so there are no literal ropes being displayed in the simulation,
      just rope calculations being used implicitly in the cloth simulation.
    </p>
    <h2>Cloth Simulation</h2>
    <p>
      I added horizontal ropes as the instructions directed and was able to create a
      simulated version of a cloth. I use a fairly standard example, with the cloth
      falling onto a ball and making satisfying cloth-like motions due to hitting the
      ball. I placed the ball slightly off center, so you get this really interesting
      side-to-side movement in the cloth that reminds me of clothes flowing in the
      breeze.
    </p>
    <h2>3D Simulation</h2>
    <p>
      The simulation is done in 3D and a user can use the camera to move around it.
      You simply hit the WASD keys to move, and the arrow keys to change the camera's
      rotation. It's almost like a video game, but using arrow keys rather than the 
      mouse.
    </p>

    <h1>Code</h1>
    <p>
      The simulation was written using
      <a href="https://processing.org/">processing</a>. The
      in-class rope activity was used as a base for creating the
      simulation, but it has been significantly modified. Almost none of the
      original code remains.
    </p>

    <h1>Difficulties</h1>
    <h2>Collision with the Sphere</h2>
    <p>
        While we have discussed collisions quite a bit in class, it's a bit
        more difficult to get good looking collisions with the cloth. It
        deforms and kind of stretches and this can be difficult to work with.
        If the cloth deforms too much on the sphere, and the push is not strong
        enough, the sphere will show through the cloth and it will look bad. However,
        setting too strong of forces can make the cloth float. It can also make it
        jitter, which is a problem still kind of present in my final submission.
    </p>
    <p>
        Overall, it mainly came down to using the same basic logic, but tinkering
        quite a bit with the parameters until the collision looked good and produced
        a good looking cloth movement.
    </p>
    <h2>Non-Angular Cloth</h2>
    <p>
        If you don't have enough polygons to render the cloth, it can look very
        angular and it breaks the immersion quite a bit. The problem is that adding
        too many polygons can give your computer quite the hit, and will reduce
        how smooth you can make the overall motion.
    </p>
    <p>
        Just like before, there was no supremely elegant solution to this problem,
        and, if there is one, I simply didn't have the time to work it out. Instead,
        I just adjusted the parameters until I had a good balance between the amount
        of polygons and the smoothness of motion.
